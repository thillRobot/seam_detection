Abstract

MAG welding is widely used for thin sheet metal applications such as car body structures due to its ability to tolerate a fair amount of deviation of the components from the ideal shape. In MAG welding, the process window is sufficiently large to accommodate the expected component tolerances. In practice, however, quality control is an issue since most welds are produced with parameters outside of the optimum range, especially in the case of automated MAG welding. To ensure best performance, a robust real-time control law is needed that adapts critical process parameters to the changing conditions, most notably the variation in gap height. Here, the gap-dependent adaptive control algorithm for the deposition of filler material and the related energy input comes into play. With an optical sensor that is mounted in front of the torch, the system measures the actual position of the two components in real-time during the entire welding process and the controller adapts the relevant parameters accordingly using a dynamic process model. This optimization ensures that only the required filler material is used and the associated energy input is tightly controlled to assure best quality even in a fully automated welding process.
