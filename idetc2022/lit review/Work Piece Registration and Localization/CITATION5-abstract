Title:
Adaptively Controlled High Brightness Laser-Arc Hybrid Welding

Abstract:
Adaptively controlled hybrid laser-arc welding has been demonstrated using a 5kW 6 mm.mrad Yb fibre laser.
ISO 13919-1 class B (stringent) quality butt welds have been made in both 8 mm thickness steel plate and
6 mm stainless steel plate. A laser vision sensor has been used to track the joints robotically during welding.
In addition, joint fit-up information from the sensor (gap width and mismatch height) has been used during
welding to adjust, in real time, the robot speed or arc welding parameters. This approach increases the
tolerance of hybrid welding, particularly to joint gap, producing stringent quality welds over a wider
range of joint fit-up cases than with fixed conditions.
