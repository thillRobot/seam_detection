Title:
A robotic welding system using image processing techniques and a CAD model to provide information to a multi-intelligent decision module

Abstract:
Purpose – The paper aims to propose a system that uses a combination of techniques to
suggest weld requirements for ships parts. These suggestions are evaluated, decisions
are made and then weld parameters are sent to a program generator.
Design/methodology/approach – A pattern recognition system recognizes shipbuilding parts
using shape contour information. Fourier-descriptors provide information and neural
networks make decisions about shapes. Findings – The system has distinguished between
various parts and programs have been generated so that the methods have proved to be
valid approaches. Practical implications – The new system used a rudimentary curvature
metric that measured Euclidean distance between two points in a window but the improved
accuracy and ease of implementation can benefit other applications concerning curve
approximation, node tracing, and image processing, but especially in identifying
images of manufactured parts with distinct corners. Originality/value – A new proposed
system has been presented that uses image processing techniques in combination with
a computer-aided design model to provide information to a multi-intelligent decision
 module. This module will use different criteria to determine a best weld path. Once
 the weld path has been determined then the program generator and post-processor can
 be used to send a compatible program to the robot controller. The progress so far is described.
